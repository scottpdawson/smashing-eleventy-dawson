I am a 16 year old student at Trumansburg High School. I've studied piano for 10 years and achieved high scores in performances at NYSSMA _(New York State School Music Association)_ events. My scores include 27/28 2013 _(level 3), 27/28_ 2014 _(level 4),_ 96/100 2015 _(level 5), and 98/100 2016 (level 6)_.

I am also a percussionist. I am a member of the  of the Trumansburg High School band and jazz band.

I am a member of the Trumansburg Cross Country team, I am a downhill ski racer for Bristol Mountain Race Club, and I'm the only member of the girl's golf team for Trumansburg schools.

I have been teaching lessons for two years and enjoy sharing my passion for piano with each of my students.
